#### 1.1 Removed Over-Engineered Security Features ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Complex security features were over-engineered for a static site generator
- **Impact**: High - Unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden
- **Solution**: Removed complex security features and simplified to basic, appropriate security measures
- **Complexity**: Major
- **Status**: ✅ Completed - Removed over 30,000 lines of unnecessary security-related code

#### 1.2 Simplified Development Server ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Development server had complex CORS and WebSocket authentication
- **Impact**: Medium - Unnecessary complexity for development use
- **Solution**: Simplified to basic static file serving and live reload
- **Complexity**: Major
- **Status**: ✅ Completed - Simplified development server to essential functionality

#### 1.3 Removed Timeout Management ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Complex timeout management system was unnecessary
- **Impact**: Medium - Over-engineering for static site generation
- **Solution**: Removed TimeoutManager and simplified to basic file operations
- **Complexity**: Major
- **Status**: ✅ Completed - Removed complex timeout system

## Current Status

The major refactoring has been completed successfully. Hirundo now focuses on core static site generation functionality with appropriate, simplified security measures.

### Key Improvements Made:
- Removed complex security features that were inappropriate for a static site generator
- Simplified configuration to essential settings only
- Streamlined development server to basic functionality
- Reduced codebase by over 30,000 lines
- Improved maintainability and ease of use
- Maintained core functionality while removing unnecessary complexity

### Remaining Work:
- Monitor for any issues with the simplified implementation
- Consider adding features based on actual user needs rather than theoretical security requirements
- Focus on performance and usability improvements
